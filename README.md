# Hadoop exercise

## Introduction
This exercise was completed in preparation for the Big Data course at [University of Zanjan](https://www.znu.ac.ir/en) in 2021.

To install Hadoop and perform examples of MapReduce, we need to have at least two VMs, one of which is the master node and the others are the slave nodes. In this report, we will have a master node and a slave node. VirtualBox software has been used to create VMs, and Ubuntu 18.04 operating system will be installed for each VM. 

* Install VirtualBox and create VMs
* Network configuration for VMs in VirtualBox
* Install openjdk and openssh on nodes
* Install Hadoop
* Hadoop confiuration for master and slave nodes
* YARN configuration
* copy and move files into Hadoop
